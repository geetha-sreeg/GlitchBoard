This is my journal of the design and building process of **Custom Devboard: GlitchBoard**.

## 10/4/2025 - finished the 'power' section of my devboard  

What I did: (SCHEMATIC)
- added decoupling capacitors to the main powerpins and powerlines on 
- worked on the powersource architecture, i.e., the USB-C
- worked on regulating the voltage of the USBC (by using a NCP1117-3.3_SOT223)

I mainly finished the 'power' section of the guide. I started worked on the crystal oscillator, but I haven't done much yet.

I also researched some extra features to add to this board! I'm thinking of a mini OLED with a cute smiley face?

Here's a pic of what I've finished so far :)
